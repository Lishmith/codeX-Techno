# Iris Flower Classification – Internship Project

This project is part of my Data Science internship with CODEX TECHNO (Task 1).

Iris flowers have three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — which differ based on petal and sepal measurements. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning classification model that learns from these features and accurately classifies iris species.

## 🔍 About the Dataset
We use a CSV-based Iris dataset from Kaggle:
➡️ [Kaggle Dataset – Iris.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabh00007/iriscsv)

This dataset contains:
- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm
- Species

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Data visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Trees / Random Forest
- Accuracy evaluation using confusion matrix and classification reports

## 📽️ Demo

## 📌 Note
This project is for internship submission purposes only. Based on a public Kaggle dataset and adapted from multiple open-source learning repositories.
