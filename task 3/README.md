## 📌 Project Overview

Sales prediction refers to forecasting how much of a product people are likely to purchase based on how and where you advertise it. This helps businesses make data-driven marketing decisions to maximize return on investment.

In this project, machine learning models are trained to predict the sales of a product using features such as:
- TV Advertising Spend
- Radio Advertising Spend
- Newspaper Advertising Spend

## 🧠 Key Steps Performed

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed relationships between advertising channels and sales.
- Visualized feature distributions, correlations, and trends using:
  - Heatmaps
  - Pairplots
  - Regression plots

### 🔹 Model Training & Evaluation
The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:
| Model                | Status     |
|----------------------|------------|
| Linear Regression    | ✅ Tested   |
| Decision Tree        | ✅ Tested   |
| Random Forest        | ✅ Best Performer |
| Gradient Boosting    | ✅ Tested   |
| Support Vector Machine | ✅ Tested   |

✅ Random Forest Regression gave the best performance:
- 🎯 Accuracy: 97.91%

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Result Highlights
- Random Forest outperformed all other models in both training and testing metrics.
- Key finding: TV and Radio advertising had stronger correlation with sales than Newspaper.
