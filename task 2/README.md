# Unemployment Analysis during COVID-19 in India

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at Codex Techno. The goal is to analyze the unemployment trends across different regions of India during the COVID-19 pandemic using data science techniques.

Dataset Source:  
📊 [Kaggle – Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)

## 🧠 Project Objective

To study how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced unemployment patterns in India by performing data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization using Python and its data science ecosystem.

## 📌 Key Steps & Highlights

### 🔹 Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Cleaned column names and handled missing/null values.
- Converted date column to datetime format for temporal analysis.

### 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Extracted Year and Month from the Date column.
- Created new temporal columns to support time-based trends.

### 🔹 Visualizations
1. 📍 Unemployment Rate by Region (Count Plot)
2. 🌐 Scatter Plot – States with High Unemployment
3. 🔎 Focused View – States with >50% Unemployment
4. 📈 Yearly Trend Table – Styled with Gradient Background
